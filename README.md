# Open Anime Tracker

This is a project meant to solve 2 issues in the Anime Community.
1. Fix the issue of newly aired shows usurping the highest rated anime on the site and then subsequently dropping off after 2 episodes.
2. Give those anime a fighting chance at passing the highest rated anime by going against what most anime trackers do: Spliting series up into seasons and never congretating them together, having them stand on their own against complete 1 season shows and movies.

Python version: ```3.10```
Node version: ```20.11.1```
